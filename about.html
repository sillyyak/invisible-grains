        Sophia Bagley is a rising senior at The Harker School in San Jose,
        California. She is a Girl Scout of 13 years who has been with her troop
        since kindergarten. Her interest in celiac disease stems from her own
        diagnosis at age 9, and she has been passionate about finding a cure for
        the disease and advocating for the celiac community ever since. As a
        recent camp counselor for Camp Celiac at Camp Arroyo, she has heard
        countless stories from children about what it’s like to live with the
        disease. She hopes that in publishing this book, she can spread
        awareness on the social implications of day-to-day life with celiac for
        both adults and kids. In her free time, she enjoys conducting research
        in an organic chemistry lab, volunteering with her Girl Scout troop,
        playing the flute in her school orchestra, stunting with her cheer team,
        and singing in her competitive choir. in order to spread awareness about
        Celiac.
