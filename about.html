      Hi everyone! My name is Sophia and I'm a Girl Scout from nothern
      California currently pursuing the Gold Award, which is the highest
      recognition that a Girl Scout can receive. The Gold Award is designed as a
      "Take-Action" project in which you identify a problem with a related
      community in need and then solve that problem with a sustainable action.
      For my Gold Award, I want to publish and distribute a book on Celiac
      Disease. Through this form, I will collect personal stories and art from
      people with Celiac Disease, eventually compiling them into a greater
      anthology. The goal of this book would be to educate and inform people
      about the impacts of Celiac Disease on daily life through storytelling in
      order to spread awareness about Celiac.
      <br /><br />
      I am looking mostly for people who are currently diagnosed with Celiac,
      but I will also accept responses from people who have a family member or
      friend with Celiac or are a medical professional dealing with Celiac. To
      follow along with my progress, you can follow my Instagram account
      @invisiblegrains for updates!
