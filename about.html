        Sophia Bagley is a senior in high school. She is a Girl Scout of 13 years who has been with her troop since kindergarten. Her interest in celiac disease stems from her own diagnosis at age 10, and she has been passionate about finding a cure for the disease and advocating for the celiac community ever since. As a recent camp counselor for Camp Celiac at Camp Arroyo, she has heard countless stories from children about what itâ€™s like to live with the disease. She hopes that in publishing this book, she can spread awareness on the social implications of day-to-day life with celiac for both adults and kids. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with friends, playing the flute, singing in her choir, conducting research, and volunteering.
