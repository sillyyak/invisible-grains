        Celiac disease is a serious autoimmune disorder that can affect people
        of all ages, backgrounds, and genders. For this condition, consuming
        gluten causes an immune response that damages the lining of the small
        intestine known as the villi. This can cause malabsorption of nutrients
        as well as a wide range of digestive symptoms. The list of symptoms is
        long, and some common side effects include anemia, skin rashes,
        infertility, reduced bone-density, and even psychological disorders.
        Beyond its physical impacts, celiac disease has a quieter, more
        invisible side: the social and emotional toll it takes on daily life.
        Dining out, travelling, or even hanging out with friends becomes
        significantly more isolating. Explaining your needs and constantly
        asking questions can feel repetitive and tiresome. And still, many
        people have never even heard of the disease.

        This disease only affects about one percent of the population, yet only
        about 83% of the estimated 1% of people with celiac disease remain
        undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This is largely due to the lack of
        education, discussion, and awareness. Most people are not aware that
        gluten–the trigger for celiac–is found not only in pasta and bread but
        also hidden in sauces, spices, and flavorings. Being on a gluten-free
        diet is exhausting, and while for some people being gluten-free can be a
        trendy lifestyle choice, people with celiac must follow the diet
        strictly for the rest of their lives.

          The Gold Award is the highest recognition that a Girl Scout can
          receive. It is designed as a “take-action” project in which a Girl
          Scout identifies a problem with a related community in need and then
          solves that problem with a sustainable action. As invisible grains is
          part of a Gold Award project, its impact and sustainability must be
          measured. Please take a second to fill out my feedback form to help me
          determine how the book affected you!

          experience. For those of you who are learning about celiac disease,
          I’m curious to see how this book has educated you and if it will
          change any of your future actions. For different people, this book has
          the ability to serve different purposes.
