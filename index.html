        Celiac Disease is a serious autoimmune disease that can affect people of
        all ages, ethnicities, and genders. Recently, studies have shown that
        the prevalence of Celiac Disease is significantly increasing in the
        global population. There are no cures to this disease, and the only
        solution is to go on a 100% gluten-free diet. This can have both
        detrimental social and emotional impacts on people. The list of symptoms
        and related conditions alone would exceed this page; however, some
        common side effects include anemia, skin rashes, infertility, reduced
        bone-density, psychological disorders, and, of course, digestive issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a disease that only affects about one percent of the population, I
        am usually the first time someone has ever met a person with Celiac. One
        percent is already an incremental amount of the population, yet about
        83% of people with Celiac Disease remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
        This staggering amount is primarily a result of the lack of education
        and communication surrounding the topic. Not only do people not know
        what Celiac Disease is, but they also are not aware of what gluten is.
        The goal of this book is to educate and inform people about the impacts
        of Celiac Disease on daily life through personal stories in order to
        bridge an educational gap to spread awareness.

          The Gold Award is the highest recognition that a Girl Scout can
          receive. It is designed as a “take-action” project in which a Girl
          Scout identifies a problem with a related community in need and then
          solves that problem with a sustainable action. As invisible grains is
          part of a Gold Award project, its impact and sustainability must be
          measured. Please take a second to fill out my feedback form to help me
          determine how the book affected you!

          If you have celiac disease, I am interested in learning whether or not
          these stories resonated with you or reflected your personal
          experience. For those of you who are learning about celiac disease,
          I’m curious to see how this book has educated you and if it will
          change any of your future actions. For different people, this book has
          the ability to serve different purposes.
