      In the game of Snake, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake"
      around the board. As the snake finds apples (red squares), it grows
      larger. Unfortunately, this snake has Celiac Disease and the bread (brown
      squares) harm the snake and the score goes down. The game ends when the
      snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to
      make the snake as large as possible before that happens.
